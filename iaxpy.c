//  The benchmark function. IAXPY takes two integer arrays and a scalar as
//  input. It adds the two arrays, element by element, storing the results in
//  Result. The first term is multiplied by the scalar, called A. Hence, why
//  it is called AXPY: scalar A times X plus Y. The I in the name indicates it
//  is an integer.

    //  generally two reasons why we do not want to do this statically i.e. int
    //  X[N]. One, with the benchmark program we're making we may exceed the
    //  allowable size of a static array (yep, this is possible given we are
    //  taxing the system). Two, if you wanted to, you could dynamically adjust
    //  the workload via the command line (though this is not how it is currently
    //  set up).
