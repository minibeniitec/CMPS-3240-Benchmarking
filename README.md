# CMPS 3240 Lab: Introduction to benchmarking

## Objectives

During this lab you will:

* Benchmark a processor with arbitrary subroutines that you have coded yourself,
* Compare several machines according to the benchmarks, and
* Code in Make and C-language.

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have read or are familiar with the following topics:

* Chapter 1.6 (Clock rate, CPI and program performance)
* Knowledge of linux command line interface (CLI) and `gcc`
* Difference between execution time (also known as wall time), user time and system time
* Linear algebra operations: dot product, matrix multiplication (book has C code, calls it `dgemm()`), and AXPY
* Some experience with C language
* C-language: Heap allocation via `malloc()` and `free()`
* Some experience with `make`

Please study these topics if you are not familiar with them so that the lab can be completed in a timely manner.

## Requirements

The following is a list of requirements to complete the lab. Some labs can completed on any machine, whereas some require you to use a specific departmental server. You will find this information here.

### Software

This lab requires the following software:

* `gcc`
* `make`
* `git`

`odin.cs.csubak.edu` has these already installed. If you're on your own machine running Ubuntu/Debian and you're not certain if these things are installed run:

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential git
```  

which should install these three things. This course will use Makefiles to automate compiling your code. For this lab manual I'm assuming you've worked with Make before. If you haven't, the `makefile` included in this repository is simple enough to learn from. Take time to read the comments if this is your first time with Make.

## Background

Processors can vary quite a bit in their clock rate, CPI and program performance. Most PC-builders often only pay attention to the clock rate of a CPU but this is the tip of the iceberg. Consider two processors with the same clock rate. There is no guarantee they complete an instruction in the same amount of cycles. This is due to:

* Instructions types taking a varying amount of clock cycles;
* How manufacturers design the hardware (logic gates); and
* A varying number and type of instructions for a program.

Thus, clock rate alone is a flawed way to compare two processors. A benchmark program is often required. This defines the number and type of instructions.

The execution time of a program is (instr./program)x(cycles/instr.)x(s/cycle) where (s/cycle) is the inverse of the clock rate. The (cycles/instr.) and (s/cycle) vary from microprocessor to microprocessor. It is common practice is to use a single program thus fixing the (instr./program). This is often called benchmarking. The program used is called a benchmark program. There are industry and commercial standard benchmarks:

* https://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html
* https://www.passmark.com/
* https://www.eembc.org/

Non-standard benchmarks by individuals:

* Dhrystone
* Whetsone

Programs not intended as a benchmark but are often used as one:

* Folding@home
* SETI@home
* Jack the ripper
* Prime95<sup>a</sup>

The purpose of this lab is to create your own benchmark programs. Benchmark programs are costly operations that are ripe for optimization. We will revisit and improve these throughout the course. This repository has a starting framework to test on different machines. Perhaps the results will surprise you.

## Approach

### Part 0 - Verify `git`, `make` and `gcc`

If you're on `odin.cs.csubak.edu` skip this step. `git`, `make` and `gcc` should be installed. The following will indicate if your machine needs these things to be installed. Open a terminal, change the directory to your intended working directoy and download this repository:

```base
$ git clone https://github.com/DrAlbertCruz/CMPS-3240-Benchmarking.git
...
$ cd CMPS-3240-Benchmarking
```

Running `make all` compiles the benchmark into `test_iaxpy.out`, as well as its pre-linked binary `test_iaxpy.o`.

```shell
$ make
gcc -Wall -O0 -c test_iaxpy.c -o test_iaxpy.o
gcc -Wall -O0 -o test_iaxpy.out test_iaxpy.o
```

By default Make will execute the first target in the file. The `-Wall` flag enables all warnings from the compiler. The `-O0` flag prevents the compiler from performing any optimizations under the hood. We do not want the compiler to introduce unintended optimizations.<sup>b</sup> If you got to this point without any issues, you are clear to proceed to the next part of the lab.

### Part 1 - AXPY

The goal of this lab is to implement three benchmark programs:

```c
void iaxpy( int length, int a, int *X, int *Y, int *Result );
float fdot( int length, float *X, float *Y );
void dgemm ( int length, double *X, double *Y, double *Result );
```

`iaxpy()` has been provided. Feel free to read these operations using whatever resources at your disposal. These operations are costly array operations:

* `iaxpy` - an operation called *A times X plus Y* abbreviated as *AXPY*. The prefix `i` indicates integers. Element-wise multiplication of scalar A times `x[i]` and add `y[i]`. It is a linear cost operation. This tests integer multiplication and addition operations of a processor.<sup>c</sup>
* `fdot` - an operation called dot product. The prefix `f` indicates single-precision floating point values (`float`). Element-wise multiplication of `x[i]` and `y[i]`, and cumulatively sum the result. It is linear cost. `fdot()` tests the floating point multiplication speed of a processor.
* `dgemm` - an operation *Generic Matrix Multiplication* (DGEMM). `d` indicates double-precision floating point. Carries out a matrix multiplication. Tests floating point operations. It also tests the cache with many re-references of the same index. This is a polynomial n^2 cost operation.

Study `text_iaxpy.c` before proceeding. When you have a general understanding proceed. The idea is to create test programs for each of these operations, and `test_iaxpy.c` is one example. Each benchmark should contain the following:

1. The code for the operation
2. In `main()`, allocate space for arrays on the heap with `malloc()`
3. Call the operation/function from `main()`
4. Free the memory with `free()`

The program will run the function on an array of a *very* large size. So large that it will test the performance of a processor. Take a look at `test_iaxpy.c` by opening the file with your favorite text editor:

 ```bash
 $ vim text_iaxpy.c
 ```

The code declares and defines `iaxpy()`:

```c
void iaxpy( int length, int A, int *X, int *Y, int *Result ) {
  for( int i = 0; i < length; i++ )
    Result[i] = A * X[i] + Y[i];
}
```

It then allocates some test arrays dynamically on the heap:

```c
const int N = 200000000;
printf( "Running IAXPY operation of size %d x 1", N );

int A = 13;                                     
int *X = (int *) malloc( N * sizeof(int) );      
int *Y = (int *) malloc( N * sizeof(int) );      
int *Result = (int *) malloc( N * sizeof(int) );
iaxpy( N, A, X, Y, Result );
```

The size of the arrays is defined at compile-time as `N`. `malloc()` is used rather than defining an array the standard way via `TYPE[N]` because you cannot dynamically declare an array the later way. `malloc()` returns a pointer to an array of the size passed by argument. However, when allocating memory this way you must always free the memory via `free()` when done:

```c
free( X );
free( Y );
free( Result );
```

We also want to use `malloc()` because there are limits to the size of an array declared in the traditional way via `TYPE[N]`--due to system limitations of the size of an array that can be allocated on the stack, and we will definitely be exceeding this limit. Before proceeding to the next section, study `test_iaxpy.c`. Do the following:

* Create a test program for `fdot` from `test_iaxpy.c`, and make appropriate targets for it in the makefile.
* Repeat for `dgemm`. Note that when allocating the arrays for `dgemm` that it is n^2 so your need to modify your allocation as follows: `(double *) malloc( N * N * sizeof(double) )`. *This code is given as an example in the textbook.*

### Part 2 - Benchmarking

Now to the benchmarking. You can use the `time` command to time the performance of the benchmark. For the input size N, we want some arbitrarily large value so that we can really see the difference in run times for varying instruction types. When running any experiment, you want to run it *at least three times* and take the average, so we use a bit of scripting to call a timing operation on `./test_iaxpy.out` three times. Insert the following into the command line:<sup>d</sup>

```shell
$ for i in {1..3}; do time ./test_iaxpy.out; done;
```

This command runs the command `time ./test_iaxpy.out`, which will run the `iaxpy` operation. On my own Dell Latitude E5470 laptop I get the following:

```shell
$ for i in {1..3}; do time ./test_iaxpy.out; done;
Running IAXPY operation of size 200000000 x 1
real    0m1.397s
user    0m0.937s
sys 0m0.434s
Running IAXPY operation of size 200000000 x 1
real    0m1.398s
user    0m0.884s
sys 0m0.504s
Running IAXPY operation of size 200000000 x 1
real    0m1.365s
user    0m0.887s
sys 0m0.476s
```

Recall from the text that real (wall) time includes the time that was spent by the operating system allocating memory and doing I/O. We want to focus on the user time. So, for `iaxpy` my Dell Latitude E5470 has an average of ~0.9 seconds. You should run this benchmark operation on `odin.cs.csubak.edu` for each of the three operations. *This means you must make benchmark programs for `fdot` and `dgemm` because they are not provided with the repo.* You should get faster results because I have a slower processor. You want to run the experiment many times because factors out of your control may skew you measurement. For example, there may be too many people running the same benchmark at that exact moment.
To determine what processor you are running via the command line execute:

```shell
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6440HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz
```

you can also get the cache size with the following:

```shell
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cache size"
cache size	: 6144KB KB
```

You will get something different on `odin.cs.csubak.edu`, `sleipnir.cs.csubak.edu` and the other machines you intend to benchmark. Carry out the a benchmark of the three operations:

* `iaxpy` - For N = 200000000
* `fdot` - For N = 200000000
* `dgemm` - For N = 1024. Do not try to run this for N = 200000000 the operation is too large to run even on `odin.cs.csubak.edu`.

each on at least one more computer (other than odin). Some suggestions: the local machine you're using to ssh to `odin.cs.csubak.edu` on (if linux), `sleipnir.cs.csubak.edu` (if you have a login for that), your macbook, etc.

### On a Mac

On Mac, `cat /proc/cpuinfo` does not work. To get the cpu information from the command line execute:

```bash
$ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz
```

## Check off

For check off, do the following:

* Show your version of the DGEMM test program to the instructor
* Aggregate your results into a table, and show your results to the instructor. It should look something like:

| Operation | `iaxpy` | `fdot` | `dgemm` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Albert's Dell Latitude E5470 w/ Intel Core i5-6440HQ | 0.771 | 0.790 | 4.110 |
| Albert's 2014 Macbook Pro w/ Intel Core i7-5557U | 0.925 | 0.836 | 12.776 |
| `odin.cs.csubak.edu` w/ Intel Xeon E5-2630 v4 | 0.83 | 1.00 | 4.39 |
| Local machine Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2123 CPU @ 3.60GHz | 0.60 | 0.67 | 2.72 |

Etc. etc.

## Appendix - Mac

Mac is a POSIX operating system and should be most compatible with the labs, which were created on Debian 6.3.0 with GCC version 6.3.0. However, Mac actually uses `clang` compiler, which is different from `gcc`. They alias `gcc` to `clang`, so even if you call `gcc` you are not using it. In the future, there will be labs that look at assembly code, and the resulting assembly mnemonics will be wildly different between `gcc` and `clang`. You should be OK using your Mac for this lab. If you plan to use your laptop, you should install xcode which will contain `clang`/`gcc`:

```shell
$ xcode-select --install
```

Verify with the following:

```shell
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.2.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

You will get something similar depending on what version of Mac OS version you are using. If you're getting errors with `gcc` in Mac, sometimes doing this will help:

```shell
$ xcode-select --reset
```

This is not a complete manual for how to install a C compiler on your machine and if things get off the rails you may want to just use a departmental computer/server.

## Appendix - Windows

Untested, but assuming that you have `gcc`, `make` and `git` installed it should work. With Windows, I could never get `gcc` to work with Cygwin, so you're on your own there. This lab requires you to test a benchmark program across multiple environments (PCs), so you're encouraged to try this on machines with different configurations.

Alternatively, if you have Windows 10, you may want to install the Windows Subsystem. The labs are designed to work on Debian/Ubuntu.

## Footnotes

<sup>a</sup>Often used for thermal testing to see if you attached your heatsink properly.

<sup>b</sup>Actually, in some environments, if you enable optimization flags, the benchmark code will be audited out of the program entirely because the `for` loop is doing work on arrays that were never initialized, and the result is never used. However, we want the CPU to do the work. We do not care for the result because we are just measuring the arbitrary amount of time it takes a CPU to do the work.

<sup>c</sup>Integer arrays are important to test, even if unsophisticated, because they are 'normal' work, and designs have tended to favor floating point optimization at the expense of regular arithmetic.

<sup>d</sup>It is possible for you to do this within Make as well.
